# 10,20,30% removed data imputed with KNN : TO TAKE OUT 10,20,30%, SAVE MODIFIED FILE AND IMPUTE WITH KNN: code was used to remove 10% ,20% ,30% for known data and then it was imputed using KNN method of imputation.
# MAE and normalized fractional error KNN : TO CALCULATE MAE AND NORMALIZED FRACTIONAL ERROR : code was used to evaluate the KNN imputation by calculating the MAE and normalised fractional error.
# KS T test - KNN : TO CALCULATE KS&T TEST, SUMMARY STATISTICS : code was used to evaluate the KNN imputation by calculating the KS test and T test.
# KDE plots for numerical values- KNN & MICE : TO CREATE KDE PLOTS FOR NUMERICAL VARIABLES : code was used to visualise the numerical values by using KDE plots.The data was imputed using both Mice and KNN and compared with the original data.The variables shown : BISi', 'SRi', 'BIS6', 'SR6', 'ABGpH', 'age', 'glucAdm', 'HCO3Adm', 'height', 'lactateAdm', 'minAmb', 'minArrestTilTargTemp', 'minCPRmed', 'minTilROSC', 'PaO2min', 'targTemp', 'targTempAdditional', 'weight'.
# KDE plots for 20% removed data values- KNN & MICE : TO CREATE KDE PLOTS FOR NUMERICAL VARIABLES WITH 20% removed known data : code was used to visualise the numerical values by removing 20% known data by using KDE plots.The data was imputed using both Mice and KNN and compared with the original data.The variables shown : BISi', 'SRi', 'BIS6', 'SR6', 'ABGpH', 'age', 'glucAdm', 'HCO3Adm', 'height', 'lactateAdm', 'minAmb', 'minArrestTilTargTemp', 'minCPRmed', 'minTilROSC', 'PaO2min', 'targTemp', 'targTempAdditional', 'weight'.
# Bar graphs - categorical data -KNN & Mice : BAR GRAPHS FOR CATEGORICAL: code was used to visualise the categorical values using bar plots.The data was imputed using both Mice and KNN and compared with the original data.The variables shown : 'echoWithin12','glasgow','rankinPrior', 'CPCprior', 'hospCondition', 'initRhythm', 'minTilROSCConfidence', 'smoker'.
# Overall MAE- KNN & Mice: Calculate overall MAE for KNN : code used to calculate the overall MAE for MICe and KNN imputaion methods
