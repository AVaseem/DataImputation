# 10,20,30% removed data imputed with KNN : TO TAKE OUT 10,20,30%, SAVE MODIFIED FILE AND IMPUTE WITH KNN: code was used to remove 10% ,20% ,30% for known data and then it was imputed using KNN method of imputation
# MAE and normalized fractional error KNN : TO CALCULATE MAE AND NORMALIZED FRACTIONAL ERROR : code was used to evaluate the KNN imputation by calculating the MAE and normalised fractional error 
# KS T test - KNN : TO CALCULATE KS&T TEST, SUMMARY STATISTICS : code was used to evaluate the KNN imputation by calculating the KS test and T test 
# KDE plots for numerical values- KNN & MICE : TO CREATE KDE PLOTS FOR NUMERICAL VARIABLES : code was used to visualise the numerical values by using KDE plots.The data was imputed using both Mice and KNN and compared with the original data.The variables shown : BISi', 'SRi', 'BIS6', 'SR6', 'ABGpH', 'age', 'glucAdm', 'HCO3Adm', 'height', 'lactateAdm', 'minAmb', 'minArrestTilTargTemp', 'minCPRmed', 'minTilROSC', 'PaO2min', 'targTemp', 'targTempAdditional', 'weight'
